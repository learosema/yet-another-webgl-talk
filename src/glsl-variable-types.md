- [`attribute`](https://thebookofshaders.com/glossary/?search=attribute) – vertex data from WebGL buffers, only accessible in the vertex shader.
- [`uniform`](https://thebookofshaders.com/glossary/?search=uniform) – like global variables you pass in from the JavaScript side before executing the program
- [`varying`](https://thebookofshaders.com/glossary/?search=varying) – passing attributes from the vertex shader to the fragment shader and interpolate in between coordinates
